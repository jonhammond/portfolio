      <p>One of my goals is to graduate from Galvanize ready to combine coding and GIS mapping. I want to be able to build what I want, or what others need to process information in any discipline. I would love to be part of any interdisciplinary team working in the area of climate change. Another goal of mine is to acquire the ability to identify and solve programming problems, and I hope to be the kind of programmer who can draw from a variety of languages to build programs and solve problems. However, it is not my goal to learn code as an end in and of itself. I want to learn how to learn to program. My biggest goal after graduating from Galvanize is to have a solid foundation from which I can continue to learn on my own and collaboratively. </p>
